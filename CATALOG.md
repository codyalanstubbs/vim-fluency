# Base Vim Pinpoint Catalog

Scope: vim ≥ 7 with no plugins, no LSP, no fuzzy finder. The subset present on every Linux server.

Conventions:
- **Probe format** — what the learner sees and what they produce.
  - `S→K` = show before/after buffer state, learner types minimal keystrokes
  - `K→S` = show keystrokes, learner predicts buffer state
  - `Disc` = discrimination: pick the more efficient of two equivalent sequences
  - `Recall` = name the keystroke that does X
- **Aim** — starting guess for fluency frequency (correct/min). All aims are placeholders to be revised by data. Bias: tool-level pinpoints high (40–60/min), text-object combos mid (20–30/min), composites low (3–8/min).
- **Prereqs** — pinpoint IDs that must reach aim first.

## Tier 0 — Survival (must be automatic before anything else)

| ID | Pinpoint | Probe | Aim | Prereqs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0.1 | Enter/leave insert mode (`i`, `a`, `Esc`) | S→K | 50 | — |
| T0.2 | Open new line (`o`, `O`) | S→K | 40 | T0.1 |
| T0.3 | Save / quit / force-quit (`:w`, `:q`, `:wq`, `:q!`, `ZZ`) | Recall | 30 | — |
| T0.4 | Undo / redo (`u`, `Ctrl-r`) | S→K | 50 | — |

Composite emergence test: "open a file, change one word, save, quit" cold, ≤ 5 s.

---

## Tier 2 — Operators (no motion yet, just the operator + linewise form)

| ID | Pinpoint | Probe | Aim | Prereqs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Discriminate `x` vs `dd` (single-char delete vs linewise; navigate then operate) | Disc | 35 | T0 |
| 2.2 | Discriminate `>>` vs `<<` (indent vs dedent direction) | Disc | 35 | T0 |

Discrimination probe **2.D**: given a goal, pick `d` vs `c` (composite emergence — does the learner know `c` enters insert mode, `d` doesn't?). Aim 35.

---

## Tier 3 — Text Objects (taught isolated, used only with operators in Tier 4)

| ID | Pinpoint | Probe | Aim | Prereqs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Word objects (`iw`, `aw`, `iW`, `aW`) — describe what they cover | Recall | 40 | 1B |

---

## Tier 4 — Adduction layer: operator × {motion, text object}

This tier is **measured but not directly trained**. If Tiers 2+3 are at aim and combinations don't appear, the components weren't fluent enough — drop back, don't drill the combinations.

| ID | Pinpoint | Probe | Aim | Prereqs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Operator + word motion (`dw`, `cw`, `yw`, `cb`, `de`) | S→K | 35 | 2, 1B |
| 4.2 | Operator + line motion (`d$`, `D`, `c0`, `y^`) | S→K | 35 | 2, 1A |
| 4.3 | Operator + char-find (`dt,`, `df)`, `ct"`, `yT(`) | S→K | 30 | 2, 1C |
| 4.4 | Operator + text object (`diw`, `ci"`, `ya{`, `dit`) | S→K | 30 | 2, 3 |
| 4.5 | Operator + search (`d/foo`, `c/bar`) | S→K | 20 | 2, 1F |
| 4.6 | Operator + match (`d%`, `y%`) on balanced delimiters | S→K | 25 | 2, 1E.3 |

**Adduction validation:** introduce `f` (find char) and a new operator `c`. Without specifically practicing `cf,`, learner should produce it cold ≥ 80% of the time within 1 s. If not, components weren't fluent.

---

## Tier 5 — Counts and repetition

| ID | Pinpoint | Probe | Aim | Prereqs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Counted motion (`5w`, `3j`, `2}`) | S→K | 40 | 1 |

| 5.3 | Count between operator and motion (`d3w`, `c2f,`) | S→K | 30 | 4 |
| 5.4 | Dot repeat (`.`) — predict effect | K→S | 35 | 2 |
| 5.5 | Discriminate when `.` is enough vs when macro is needed | Disc | 20 | 5.4, 12 |

---

| 6.7 | Join lines (`J`, `gJ`) | S→K | 35 | T0 |
| 6.8 | In-insert: backspace word (`Ctrl-w`), kill line (`Ctrl-u`) | S→K | 30 | T0 |
| 6.9 | In-insert: literal char (`Ctrl-v{c}`), digraph (`Ctrl-k`) | Recall | 20 | T0 |

---

## Tier 7 — Visual mode

---

## Tier 13 — Composite skills (validation set, not training)

These are **untaught** composite tasks. Run them periodically to validate that component fluency is producing real-world editing speed. Probe = task description + starting buffer; measure time-to-completion and keystroke efficiency vs an expert reference.

| ID | Composite | Components exercised |
|---|---|---|
| C.1 | Rename a variable inside the current function | 1F.2, 9.1, 10.4 |
| C.2 | Wrap a block in `try:`/`except:` (or `if (…) { }`) | 7, 6.6, 5.4 |
| C.3 | Sort a contiguous block of imports alphabetically | 11.4 |
| C.4 | Delete every line containing `TODO` | 10.8 |
| C.5 | Reflow a paragraph to 80 cols (`gqap`) | 2, 3.4 |
| C.6 | Swap two arguments in `foo(a, b)` | 4.4, 8.1 |
| C.7 | Indent a function body one level | 7, 2.4 |
| C.8 | Convert `snake_case` → `camelCase` for one identifier | 12 |
| C.9 | Comment out a contiguous block | 7.6 (block insert) |
| C.10 | Move the current line below the next 3 lines | 2.1, 5.1, 8.1 |

Pass criterion: keystroke count within ~120% of expert reference, completed without consulting docs.

## Aim derivation note

All aim numbers above are **starting guesses**, not empirically derived. The actual experiment is: train one cohort on these pinpoints, measure (a) celeration to aim, (b) composite performance on Tier 13 at varying component-fluency levels. Tighten or relax aims based on what actually predicts composite emergence. This is the missing data the literature doesn't have for vim.
